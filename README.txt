// Explanation:

Lab3Task1:
  Lab3Task1 implements a method that produces a formatted array/list.
  The method print2Darray takes in a 2-dimensional Int array as a parameter and prints a formatted 4x4 two dimensional integer array using a nested for loop.
  print2DList takes in a 2-dimensional list as a parameter and prints a formatted 4x4 two dimensional integer list using a nested for loop.

Lab3Task2:
  Lab3Task2 implements a method that produces a running sum.
  runningSum2DArray takes in a 2-dimensional Int array and an integer as parameters and prints a formatted modified array after producing the running sums according to the direction. It uses different nested for loops according to direction and thus its parameters.
  runningSum2DArrayList takes in a 2-dimensional list and an integer as parameters and prints a formatted modified list after producing the running sums according to the direction. It uses different nested for loops according to direction and thus its parameters.

Lab3Task3:
  Lab3Task3 implements a method that iterates through an array / a list.
  printArrayListBasicLoop iterates through the list using a basic for loop.
  printArrayListEnhancedLoop iterates through the list using an enhanced for loop.
  printArrayListForLoopListIterator iterates through the list using a basic for loop with an iterator.
  printArrayListWhileLoopListIterator iterates through the list using a basic while loop with iterator.
